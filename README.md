# DataScience_PimaIndiansDiabetes_Classification
The objective of the dataset is to predict whether or not a patient has diabetes, based on certain diagnostic measurements. It is a binary classification with multiple numerical features. The methodology I am utilizing for this project involves the implementation of pipelines to construct a robust model that mitigates the risk of data leakage.
